Bitcoin Core
=============

Intro
-----
Tapyrus is a blockchain that has been forked from Bitcoin Core, and solves the governance issues. Bitcoin uses Proof of Work as a consensus algorithm, but Tapyrus creates a block (ie, approves a transaction) with multiple signatures from the Signer group which consists of industry stakeholders. Therefore, transactions on the blockchain are stably approved, and finality is given at the time of approval. Anyone can join the Tapyrus network, and anyone can access the public ledger and create and broadcast transactions freely.

Setup
-----
Unpack the files into a directory and run tapyrus_qt.exe.

Tapyrus core is the original Tapyrus node and it builds the backbone of the network.
However, it downloads and stores the entire history of Tapyrus blockchain;
depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization
process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more.
