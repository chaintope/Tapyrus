## Tapyrus core GUI

Tapyrus GUI has been enhanced to allow Token transactions. Following are the changes made

### Overview Page
Overview in the new Tapyrus GUI shows tokens as well. _Prev_ and _Next_ buttons can be used to scroll through all the available tokens. Only TPC is shown when no other tokens are available.

### Send Token
Sending a token is the same as sending TPC except that the new address must have been generated with the colorid 

> ./src/tapyrus-cli -conf=~/.tapyrus/ getnewaddress "NFT" c3b8b7e3a2684c746d367420bd0899104005cfeeb59705a3f402fa37312f402624

Then the token lable would be populated automatically and "TOKEN" would be set in the token type drop down.

### Receive Token
Receiving tokens is also similar to receiving TPC. In addition to lable, message and amount, Token should also be populated.

A new entry is added to the payment history table after the address is generated.
