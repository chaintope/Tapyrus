Versioning Rule
================

Basically, Tapyrus's versioning rule is based on [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org).

* Tapyrus Core and Tapyrus Signer MUST use same major, minor version.  
For example, when Tapyrus core v0.3.0 is going to be released, Tapyrus Signer v0.3.0 is also going to be released. However patch version release is not. Just one side can be released.
